## Introduction
The goal of this site to is act as a dev log for what I'm calling "Neural Pineapple". It's an experiment to see if I can make money from making mobile games. I plan on writing regular income reports. I've seen several different types of sites, both gamedev and completely unrelated to gamedev, do these income reports. While I think that it's part of their marketing strategy, I'm mainly using the idea to hold myself accountable right now.

The games I make will be in Unity and I'll probably be making extensive use of the Asset Store, which will be included in my expenses section of the report.

### Who Am I?
I've been a software developer for about 8 years, and I've done both web development and game development professionally. I've been using Unity for about the same amount of time and I've made several small games in the past. But they weren't that great and didn't make any money. I haven't released anything in around 5 years.

### Goals
- regularly update this site with relevant information
- be transparent where I can with income numbers.
- show how horrible it all goes (if it all goes horribly)
- update with relevant plans and tasks

## What I Did This Week
This week has been writing out game design documents and setting up this blog. I've got 4 ideas, 2 of which will not be possible until much later. So I think I've decided on my first game.

## Other Stuff
I've seen other "income report" type blogs write out interesting things they've done in real life here, or whatever games or shows they have been watching.

So, this week in my free time I played just a little of Outer Worlds and watched Jack Ryan Season 2.

## Income Report

Here's where I'll have a small table with income and expenses. Right now I have 0 of both since I'm still in the planning and design phase.

## Summary

So that's the first half week in the books. I mainly wanted to get this blog up and have a short introduction to what I'm planning to do here. I think I've decided on my first idea to make into a game, so maybe I'll post small updates about the work I complete in between income reports.
