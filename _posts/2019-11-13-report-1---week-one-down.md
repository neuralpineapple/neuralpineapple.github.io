## What I Did This Week
### Design Work
I spent the first half of the week wrapping up some more design work. I decided that the first game will be a top down, low-poly shooter set in modern times. I'm thinking that it will be similar to [Running With Rifles](https://store.steampowered.com/app/270150/RUNNING_WITH_RIFLES/) but adapted for mobile play. The player will be a specific character with special abilities that is fighting against an entire army. Additional characters can be recruited to help or they can be unlocked and you can play as them. I'm also adding multiplayer so that friends can play together.
### Character Movement
Once the basic design was decided, I started creating the base game during the latter half of the week. The initial start of a new game is always the most fun since you're able to get so much done really quickly and see the results. I've got basic movement, movement while facing target, and camera tracking done.

I also got basic weapon equipping and the first iteration of firing a projectile, but no gifs of that yet. Next week I should be able to show how that looks.

## Other Stuff
This week I watched Zombieland 2 and The Joker. I spent a few hours playing the space sim [X3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/201310/X3_Albion_Prelude/), which is an older game that I had played years ago. Every so often I'll come back and play it for a few days until I get lost in how much depth there is in that game.

## Summary
Off to a good start. If I get enough work done I'll post again next week. And at the end of the month I'll do my first income report, which will just be a list of expenses so far. In the future, I will hopefully have some profits to report but until I actually release something, I doubt the income reports will be that interesting.
