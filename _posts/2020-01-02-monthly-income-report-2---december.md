## What I Did This Month

### More Prototyping and Content

For December, I spent most the majority of my working time carving out more core gameplay and mechanics, and making sure everything worked in a multiplayer environment. Once that was finished, I spent some time working on the main menu UI and navigation. Then I started adding some content like characters and weapons (see screenshots below). I think the work for January will be creating some level content and more polish.

With the holidays and travel, I did not work very much on the 2nd half of the month on the game.

### A some polish

I did start adding some polish like a few lerps in the UI and some IK based recoil, which I think turned out really nice.

## Income Report
Obviously since I'm still prototyping the game I haven't made any money at all. But I figured I'd include all the assets I'm using. I'm using the list price for the assets so it's not 100% accurate since I've purchased most of these in the past when they were on sale and over the course of several years, but it's better than nothing.

Source | This Month | Total
-------|---------------
Unity Assets | -$105 | -$828.98
**Total** | **-$105** | **-$828.98**

### Unity Assets Breakdown

Asset Name | Cost
-----------|-----
Final IK | $90
DOTween | $15
**Total** | **$105**


## Other Stuff
With the holidays, I didn't work much in the second half of the month. I'm hoping this month to get a substantial amount done so that I can go through a play session from start to finish.
