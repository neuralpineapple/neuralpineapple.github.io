## What I Did This Week
### More Design Work
I spent a little more time fleshing out the idea for the game. The idea behind the game is you are one soldier against many enemies. It should be a top down action game. The only penalty for dying is a small respawn timer (with possible rewarded ads to skip timer). And co-op will be included on release. The last big thing is having a large list of characters that can be unlocked or purchased, each with a unique special ability.
### Movement, Firing, and Health (networked)
The bulk of the work was spent building out those systems and networking them together. I'm using [Photon PUN](https://www.photonengine.com/en-us/PUN) for the networking since I've used it before in the past and it's relatively simple (at least, for networking).

I've got the movement systems in place, a weapon inventory where you can equip / unequip weapons and then fire them, ammo and reloading, hit detection, and health all working and synced across a networked game.

### Main Menu Design
I also started working on the main menu. I like the idea of the background being an actual 3d space, so I started putting together a basic scene and some camera transitions. I think the basics turned out pretty well, so I'll keep working the idea and see what I come up with.

## Other Stuff
This week I started playing Red Dead Redemption 2. I was pretty busy with work so I didn't really watch anything or play that much. And this week with Thanksgiving holiday in the US I'll probably be busy again. Hopefully I'll find some time to get some work done on the game.

## Summary
It felt good this week to get the networking stuff working and add a few graphical assets. I'm planning using this super low poly style for the game, just because it's easy to work with, I have the assets, and I think it looks pretty good. Again, not sure how much work I'll be able to get done this week with the holidays, but hopefully I'll have a little more to show next week.
