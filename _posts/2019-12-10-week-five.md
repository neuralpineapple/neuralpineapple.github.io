## What I Did This Week
### Combat and Core Gameplay
Basic combat is now working. The idea behind the gameplay is that the map is covered in Sectors, and each one of these Sectors has a number of enemies that have to be defeated in order to win that Sector. Once you've won all the Sectors or the map, you complete that level.

So, I've got a rotating spawn system working, the UI showing how many enemies are left, the auto-targeting system, and hit detection all working really well. It was a pretty cool moment when everything worked together for the first time.

#### Hit Reactions
This might be overkill for a mobile game, but I added IK hit reactions for the player, and I think the effect turned out really well.

#### Death Animations
I added death animations for players and enemies, and introduced an amusing bug where an enemy would continue to attack the player after they've died, but the player would continue to play death animations every time it was hit.

### Other Stuff
This week I started playing Star Wars Battelfront 2 again. I had played for a month or two when it first came out, and randomly came across a video talking about some of the updates they've done in the last 2 years and ended up jumping back into the game.

## Summary
The gameplay is finally starting to shape up and it's all setup for multiplayer co-op as well. Pretty soon I'll start doing more tasks related to level design and quality of life features.
