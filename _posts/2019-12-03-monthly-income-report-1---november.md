## What I Did This Month
### Initial Design & Goals
At the beginning of November I decided to do this experiment. I wanted to journal my experiences about making mobile games from start to finish and include income numbers wherever I can. I spent the first few days writing out and narrowing down some the game ideas and I settled on three different main games. I took the smallest one and started writing out the design document and list of tasks for a basic prototype.

### Prototyping
Once I got enough design done I started prototyping the idea in Unity. I've spent about three weeks total, mostly working on the game in the evenings. I've actually got a decent amount of the foundational work on the game done. From the beginning I was planning on incorporating multiplayer co-op, so most all of the functionality is also properly synced across network games.

## Income Report
Obviously since I'm still prototyping the game I haven't made any money at all. But I figured I'd include all the assets I'm using. I'm using the list price for the assets so it's not 100% accurate since I've purchased most of these in the past when they were on sale and over the course of several years, but it's better than nothing.

## Other Stuff
This last week was Thanksgiving holiday, so I didn't do much work on the for a few days. It was nice to get back in to development though, and I was able to start digging into different weapon systems and enemy AI.
